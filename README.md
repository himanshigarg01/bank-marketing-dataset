# Bank Term Deposit Subscription Classification

This repository contains two notebooks showcasing the classification of a dataset related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (`variable y`).

## Notebooks

1. **classification_during_interview.ipynb**
   - This notebook was created during a technical interview, with a limited timeframe. It demonstrates the initial steps and insights I gathered within the interview duration.

2. **post_interview_classification.ipynb**
   - This notebook was revisited after the interview without time constraints. It provides a more thorough exploration of the dataset with a clear focus on improving the initial approach.

## Dataset
